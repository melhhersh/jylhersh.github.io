      <a href="#" class="w3-bar-item w3-button w3-padding-large" onclick="onClick(this)" id="Images/valentine.jpg" slot="little did i know that a wonky legged one-eyed dog would change the direction of my life.  for years i had perfect dogs.  perfect pets, actually. and lots of them.  i worked in radio for a long time, using my position to help rescue groups whenever i could.  Blue Dog Rescue in Austin Texas did me a good turn, so i was returning the favor when this totally broken puppy appeared. i was in love.  our other dogs were not.  two years later i realized that the fear that our funny little puppy was showing had grown into true fear based aggression and i needed help fixing it.  i met Lee Mannix - a bigger than life texan with a gift when it came to reading and training dogs.  he told me a few years later that when he saw my dog he didn't think she could be helped, but he agreed to work with me and (for once) kept his opinions to himself.  With Lee's help (and the help of other trainers at his center) i dealt with the issues, and more that arose - altering my personal interest into a mission to help people enjoy their dogs and to work with other fearful and reactive dogs.
      <br><br>
      Along my dog training journey I was introduced to Tellington TTouch - and have been fortunate to work frequently with the developer of the technique - Linda Tellington-Jones and her sister Robyn Hood.  Encouraged by them and the other TTouch Instructors I realized that TTouch was the tool that made the most sense for me in my search to create trusting relationships between dogs and their owners. I continue to assist Senior Instructors at 6 day trainings, and lead my own 1 and 2 day seminars on the technique. Because I infuse all my training with TTouch, I consider myself a TTouch Practitioner that Trains Dogs.
      <br><br>
      after studying with and working for Lee Mannix until his untimely death I took up dog work full time - acquiring my certification as a Pet Dog Trainer - Knowledge Assessed through CCPDT.  I’ve also trained for disaster response with Red Rovers and I’m one of a small number of Level 2 Tellington T-Touch Companion Animal Practitioners in the US.">sweetheart pet services</a>

          Ear TTouches on a catTTouch - the Tellington TTouch - is a method based on circular movements of the fingers and hands all over the body. The intent of the TTouch is to activate the function of the cells and awaken cellular intelligence - a little like 'turning on the electric lights of the body.'
          <br><br>
          The TTouch is done on the entire body, and each circular TTouch is complete within itself. Therefore it is not necessary to understand anatomy to be successful in speeding up the healing of injuries or ailments, or changing undesirable habits or behavior.
          <br><br>
          The Tellington TTouch is a specialized approach to the care and training of our animal companions. Developed by internationally recognized animal expert, Linda Tellington-Jones, PhD (Hon), this method based on cooperation and respect offers a positive approach to training, can improve performance and health and presents solutions to common behavioral and physical problems. It also helps establish a deeper rapport between humans and animals through increased understanding and more effective communication.
          <br><br>
          TTouch training for companion animals - using a labyrinthUsing a combination of specific touches, lifts, and movement exercises, TTouch helps to release tension and increase body awareness. This allows the animal to be handled without provoking typical fear responses. The animal can then more easily learn new and more appropriate behaviors. By using the TTouch and a variety of other tools, like the Confidence Course, you can assist the animal in experiencing self-confidence in previously frightening situations. Even the most difficult problems are often eliminated. You can also learn how to apply the Tellington TTouch to assist with recovery from illness or injury, or just enhance the quality of your animal's life.
