    <p>little did i know that a wonky legged one-eyed dog would change the direction of my life. 
        for years i had perfect dogs. perfect pets, actually. and lots of them. i worked in radio 
        for a long time, using my position to help rescue groups whenever i could.  Blue Dog Rescue 
        in Austin Texas did me a good turn, so i was returning the favor when this totally broken 
        puppy appeared. i was in love.  our other dogs were not.  two years later i realized that 
        the fear that our funny little puppy was showing had grown into true fear based aggression 
        and i needed help fixing it.  i met Lee Mannix - a bigger than life texan with a gift when 
        it came to reading and training dogs.  he told me a few years later that when he saw my dog 
        he didn't think she could be helped, but he agreed to work with me and (for once) kept his 
        opinions to himself.  With Lee's help (and the help of other trainers at his center) i dealt 
        with the issues, and more that arose - altering my personal interest into a mission to help 
        people enjoy their dogs and to work with other fearful and reactive dogs.
    <br><br>
        Along my dog training journey I was introduced to Tellington TTouch - and have been fortunate 
        to work frequently with the developer of the technique - Linda Tellington-Jones and her sister 
        Robyn Hood.  Encouraged by them and the other TTouch Instructors I realized that TTouch was the 
        tool that made the most sense for me in my search to create trusting relationships between dogs 
        and their owners. I continue to assist Senior Instructors at 6 day trainings, and lead my own 1 
        and 2 day seminars on the technique. Because I infuse all my training with TTouch, I consider 
        myself a TTouch Practitioner that Trains Dogs. after studying with and working for Lee Mannix 
        until his untimely death I took up dog work full time - acquiring my certification as a Pet Dog 
        Trainer - Knowledge Assessed through CCPDT.  I’ve also trained for disaster response with Red Rovers 
        and I’m one of a small number of Level 2 Tellington T-Touch Companion Animal Practitioners in the US.
