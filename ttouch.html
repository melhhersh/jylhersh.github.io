    <p>Tellington TTouch is a specialized approach to the care and training of our animal companions. Developed by internationally recognized animal expert, Linda Tellington-Jones, PhD (Hon), this method based on cooperation and respect offers a positive approach to training, can improve performance and health and presents solutions to common behavioral and physical problems. It also helps establish a deeper rapport between humans and animals through increased understanding and more effective communication.
    </p>
      <p>TTouch helps to release tension and increase body awareness. This allows the animal to be handled without provoking typical fear responses. The animal can then more easily learn new and more appropriate behaviors. By using the TTouch and a variety of other tools, lyou can assist the animal in experiencing self-confidence in previously frightening situations. Even the most difficult problems are often eliminated. You can also learn how to apply the Tellington TTouch to assist with recovery from illness or injury, or just enhance the quality of your animal's life.
      </p>
      <p>Classes and Seminars give attendees the basic components of the technique, including the Circular Touch, Groundwork Elements, and Items such as Wraps and Harnesses. The long the class, the more information, touches and techniques that can be worked on. Through demonstration and practical application the attendee will leave with tools to help their own pets, client and shelter animals to move more comfortably in their bodies and make a better connection with the humans around them.
